### My Philosophy

_"Challenge information and ask why?"_

If you read my notes, you will interpret them your own way. If the "why" is not answered, then ask!
If there are alternative solutions to a problem _(which there will be)_, then consider the trade offs, discuss them and decide which is best based on the situation.

## Goals

The goal of this site is to **[Learn In Public](https://https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)**, I first heard about it via [Swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx).
I will write for me, as a second brain, to reference and to be a catalyst in my learning and improvement.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
