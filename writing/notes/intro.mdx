# Notes

As you read, **assume I am WRONG**. Question everything, please raise any issues you come across by editing on **<ExternalLink href="https://github.com/theamateurdev/amateurdev">GitHub</ExternalLink>** or via **<ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/theamateurdev">Twitter</ExternalLink>**.

### My Philosophy

_"Challenge information and ask why?"_

If you read my notes, you will interpret them your own way. If the "why" is not answered, then ask!
If there are alternative solutions to a problem _(which there will be)_, then consider the trade offs, discuss them and decide which is best based on the situation.

## Goals

The goal of this site is to **<ExternalLink text="Learn In Public" href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public"/>**, I first heard about it via <ExternalLink text="Swyx" href="https://twitter.com/swyx"/>.
I will write for me, as a second brain, to reference and to be a catalyst in my learning and improvement.
