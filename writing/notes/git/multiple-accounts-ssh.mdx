I had this exact issue when setting up a separate persona for this site and to learn in public, so here are my notes on
how I managed to setup two git personas using ssh. (I was using https but it seemed to be even more awkward).

- Firstly, run ssh-add to see if the agent is running. Mine was not.
  Run `` eval `ssh-agent -s` `` to start the agent

- Then generate your key pairs by running `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "jane@doe.com"` (ed25519 can be replaced with rsa but is not recommended).
  It will ask for a name of the file default is **id_rsa**, however, you'll want to rename this to be unique if you have two accounts IE: **id_rsa_amateurdev**.

- Copy the SSH Public-Key inside **id_rsa_amateurdev.pub** (Remember ".pub"!), over to <ExternalLink text="GitHub" href="https://github.com/settings/keys"/>.

- Now run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_amateurdev`. This adds your private key to the ssh-agent.

- Finally, create a config file in `~/.ssh/config` with:

```text
Host github-main
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_amateurdev

Host github-secondary
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_secondary
```

This stores your identities in your ssh config so that you can use ssh with the following format based on the config above `user@host:githubUsername/githubRepo.git` = `git@github-main:username/repo.git` note that it is "git" before the @ which is the "user" in the ssh config. This is the default user when cloning from github etc.

** IF ** you are running bash and being asked for SSH passwords
when launching your terminal, or pushing to a repo.
Then you can add the below script to your `~/.bashrc`
file which will execute ssh-agent and pull in all your files
from `~/.ssh/id_!(*.pub)`. Which is saying, every file inside
.ssh that begins with "id\_" and doesn't end with ".pub".

```bash
### Set SSH Keys on startup
env=~/.ssh/agent.env
### add all files beginning with id without a .pub extension.
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_!(*.pub)
agent_load_env () { test -f "$env" && . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_start () {
    (umask 077; ssh-agent >| "$env")
    . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_load_env

# agent_run_state: 0=agent running w/ key; 1=agent w/o key; 2= agent not running
agent_run_state=$(ssh-add -l >| /dev/null 2>&1; echo $?)

if [ ! "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] || [ $agent_run_state = 2 ]; then
    agent_start
    ssh-add
elif [ "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] && [ $agent_run_state = 1 ]; then
    ssh-add
fi

unset env

```
